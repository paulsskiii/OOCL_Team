# Cargo Tracking System

## Description
Simulate the use of environment-specific configurations and familiarize with Eureka server/client.

## Status: Complete

## Exercise 2.1: Advanced Config Server for Cargo Service

1. Added environment-specific configurations (e.g., `application-dev.yml`, `application-prod.yml`) to the Config Serverâ€™s Git repository.  
2. have activated different profiles in the **cargo-service** to load different configurations.  
3. Added configuration property that determines a **shipping fee** and display it in the cargo service response.

## Exercise 2.2: Multiple Instances of Cargo Service

1. Run multiple instances of the **cargo-service** on different ports.  
2. Observe how **Eureka Server** registers all instances.  
3. *(Optional challenge)*: Use `spring.application.instance_id` to provide unique IDs for each instance.

## Exercise 2.3: Basic Client-Side Load Balancing

1. Created a new simple Spring Boot application called **shipping-portal**. 
2. Make the **shipping-portal** a Eureka Client.  
3. Used `@LoadBalanced RestTemplate` in **shipping-portal** to call the **cargo-service** by its Eureka name (e.g., `http://CARGO-SERVICE/cargo`).  
4. Demonstrate calls being distributed across multiple **cargo-service** instances.
