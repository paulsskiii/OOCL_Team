assumptions:
- container number as PK
- container owner is nullable

test cases(backend):

add functionality
- given a container object when inserted to database then should be successful and must reflect to database
- given a container object without container number when inserted to database then should return an error
- given a container object without container owner field when inserted to database then should be successful

update functionality
- given new container number when update to database then should not be successful and must reflect to database
- given new container origin when updated to database then should be successful

search functionality
- given an existing container number when searched then should return container details
- given the container origin when searched then should return empty details
- given a non-existing container number when searched then should return empty details

delete functionality
- given a container number when deleted should erase its record from database

test cases(frontend)
- given a container object when add button is clicked should reflect new container in container lists
